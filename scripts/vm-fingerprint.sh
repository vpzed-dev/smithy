# Capture the determinism fingerprint of a VM over SSH, and digest it.
#
# Records everything the environment contract pins - package set and versions,
# apt configuration, enabled units, login user, kernel - and deliberately
# excludes what is per-instance by design: SSH host keys, machine-id,
# filesystem UUIDs, MAC addresses, cloud-init instance-id, logs, timestamps.
#
# The capture is split into two parts, digested separately:
#
#   CORE      what any provider must reproduce identically for the same VM
#             definition: package set and versions, apt pinning, enabled
#             units, login user, layer-2 file trees. Two VMs built from the
#             same definition on DIFFERENT providers should agree here.
#             Excludes the software under test - see layer2 files.
#   PROVIDER  where honest differences live on the record: kernel flavour,
#             apt mirror URIs, cloud-init datasource, base image identity.
#             Expected to differ between providers; must NOT differ between
#             two rebuilds on the same provider.
#
# Both digests, plus a combined one over the whole body, are appended to the
# capture so they are committed and diffed along with it.
#
# Workflow: capture to a tracked file, commit, destroy + reprovision, capture
# again to the same path - `git diff` empty means the rebuilt VM has the same
# environment, and the digests say so in one line each.
#
#   ./scripts/vm-fingerprint.sh ubuntu@10.0.0.50 fingerprints/ubuntu-test.txt
#
# A capture can also be re-digested without touching a VM, which is how the
# comparator is tested and how existing captures are re-digested if the
# core/provider split is ever re-cut:
#
#   ./scripts/vm-fingerprint.sh --from-file fingerprints/ubuntu-test.txt
#
# Host keys are instance noise here, so known-hosts checking is disabled for
# this script only (a rebuilt VM would otherwise hard-fail the connection).
# Your interactive ssh will still complain after a rebuild: ssh-keygen -R <ip>.

# RULE: this section hashes what the environment IS. A path under these trees
# belongs in the hash only if it is (i) part of the environment rather than
# part of the software under test, and (ii) content-stable across two
# identical installs. Anything that fails either half is pruned, and anything
# pruned that still carries a fact worth keeping is re-recorded by reference
# in layer2 versions below - as a version string or a resolved ref, which does
# not move when the target moves.
#
# The expression below is the current APPLICATION of that rule, not its
# definition. This file has already been wrong twice by reading the list as
# the specification and asking only "is this path enumerated?" when a new
# directory turned up. Ask the rule instead: is this the environment, and is
# it stable? If not, prune it and record here which half it failed.
#
# Scoped to ~/.local and ~/.bun deliberately - where the ansible tool roles
# install. Hashing the whole home is non-idempotent by design (.claude.json,
# timestamped backups, caches).
#
# Fails (ii), not content-stable:
#   $d/state               claude lock files.
#   $d/install/cache/*.npm compressed download blobs, not byte-stable across
#                          installs. The extracted package trees next to them
#                          ARE stable, are what global/node_modules symlinks
#                          into, and stay in.
#
# Fails (i), it is the software under test:
#   $d/share/metafactory   arc installs packages into
#                          .local/share/metafactory/arc/repos, so hashing it
#                          folds the targets git SHA into the environment
#                          digest - and an environment whose identity moves
#                          every time the thing being tested moves cannot
#                          answer the question the digest exists for, which is
#                          "were these two runs performed under the same
#                          conditions?". Same environment, two target versions
#                          is the comparison the whole exercise is built on,
#                          so the target is recorded in the run receipt
#                          instead, as name plus resolved ref.
#   $d/bin                 the same failure arriving by a second door. arc
#                          writes a CLI shim into its shim dir (~/.local/bin
#                          by default) for every package it installs, and as a
#                          regular 0755 file, not a symlink. So the first arc
#                          install of a target drops bin/<target> straight
#                          into the hashed set: the targets name, plus a shim
#                          body naming the targets install path. Pruning
#                          share/metafactory alone does not stop that.
#
# Why bin is pruned WHOLESALE and not just the shims arc owns - crucible#14
# option (a), chosen over option (b). Option (b) needs a marker this script
# can match, and no such marker exists. arc createCliShim, via
# buildShimContent in arc src/lib/symlinks.ts, writes a POSIX shim as
# "#!/bin/bash" followed immediately by an ARC_INVOCATION_CWD export: no arc
# header line, no marker comment, nothing arc has committed to keeping.
# Matching that export line would mean reading file bodies to decide a prune,
# and pinning this repo to an undeclared implementation detail of a repo on
# the far side of the seam - one whose shim format has already changed at
# least once. A prune that can silently stop pruning is worse than no prune.
#
# The cost of (a), stated plainly: bin/nats-server is a real binary here and
# its hash leaves the digest along with it. That is accepted. Everything in
# bin is a dispatcher - a shim body is an install path, a fact about where and
# not about what - and the thing it dispatches to still lives under a tree
# that IS hashed (the bun global node_modules, the extracted install cache).
# The tooling identity bin used to carry is carried by layer2 versions below,
# which names nats-server, bun, claude and arc explicitly. If a tool is ever
# added to bin without a line there it leaves the fingerprint silently -
# test-vm-fingerprint.sh asserts those four names for exactly that reason.
#
# arc ITSELF stays in the fingerprint (see layer2 versions below): it lives in
# ~/arc, it decides how targets get installed, and it does not vary with which
# target is under test. Tooling is environment; the target is not.
